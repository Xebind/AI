AI projects

Here I show you some of my AI projects

In project 0 you can play TicTacToe against an AI using a minmaxing algorythm so that you will never win (and you may even lose!)

In project 1 we teach our PC to play Minesweeper, it learns from every move and creates inferences combining the knowledge it got so far in order to get new information.

In project 2 we emulate the PageRank algorythm, the webpage-sorting algorythm that Google used in their first years.

In project 3 we simply use AI to create crosswords with just one click.

In project 4 we make our computer play a game of Nim against itself and learn from the game. You will beat it after 1 game, but will you after the computer has trained 10.000 games?

In project 5 we toy with neural networks in order to teach our computer to differentiate between traffic signals. Pretty useful for future smart cars.

In project 6 we go one step further and teach our computer to talk. It now understands english grammar and will give you syntactical analysis for any given sentence.
